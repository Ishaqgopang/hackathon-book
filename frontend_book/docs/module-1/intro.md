# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. In this module, you will learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system of robotic systems, connecting AI agents written in Python with physical robot components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Control robots using Python through rclpy
