# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the comprehensive course on building intelligent humanoid robots using modern robotics technologies.

## Course Overview

This course is designed to take you from beginner to advanced in the field of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. You'll learn about:

- **ROS 2**: The middleware that connects AI algorithms to physical robot hardware
- **Digital Twins**: Physics-based simulation using Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization with Unity
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: AI-powered perception and navigation for intelligent robots
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Building autonomous humanoid systems

## Course Modules

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1/intro)

Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, the communication backbone of modern robotics. Understand nodes, topics, services, and how to model and control humanoid robots.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2/intro)

Explore physics-based simulation and digital twin concepts. Learn how to create realistic environments for testing and training humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/module-3/intro)

Discover how to build intelligent perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac tools. Learn about photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and accelerated perception pipelines.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action & Autonomous Humanoid Capstone](/docs/module-4/intro)

Combine everything learned to create an autonomous humanoid system capable of understanding and interacting with the world through vision, language, and action.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1](/docs/module-1/intro) to establish the foundational concepts that will be built upon throughout the course.
