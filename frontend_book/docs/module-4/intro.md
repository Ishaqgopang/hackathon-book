# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action & Autonomous Humanoid Capstone

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This capstone module brings together all the concepts learned in previous modules to create autonomous humanoid systems capable of understanding and interacting with the world through vision, language, and action.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems in a unified architecture
- Implement multimodal perception for humanoid robots
- Design embodied AI systems that combine reasoning and physical interaction
- Build end-to-end autonomous humanoid capabilities
- Validate and test complete humanoid robot systems

2. [Embodied AI: Reasoning and Physical Interaction](./chapter-2.md)
3. [Humanoid Manipulation and Grasping Strategies](./chapter-3.md)
4. [Social Interaction and Human-Robot Communication](./chapter-4.md)
5. [Autonomous Humanoid System Integration and Validation](./chapter-5.md)

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics
- Experience with system integration concepts

## Next Steps

Proceed to Chapter 1 to begin integrating all the concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid system.
