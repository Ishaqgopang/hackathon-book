# Module 3: AI Perception with NVIDIA Isaac

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course, focusing on AI perception with NVIDIA Isaac. This module covers the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for building perceptual and navigation intelligence for humanoid robots using photorealistic simulation and accelerated pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem and its components
2. Set up NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic robot simulation
3. Integrate Isaac with ROS 2 for robotic applications
4. Implement navigation intelligence using Nav2
5. Bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment

## Module Structure

This module is organized into five chapters that progressively build your understanding of NVIDIA Isaac technologies:

- **Chapter 1**: NVIDIA Isaac Overview - Introduction to the Isaac ecosystem
- **Chapter 2**: Isaac Sim - Photorealistic simulation environment
- **Chapter 3**: Isaac ROS - Integration with ROS 2
