# ROS 2 Module Specification Created

## Prompt Text

```
/sp.specify

Module: Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Audience:
Intermediate AI and software engineering students entering Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

Module Goal:
Enable learners to understand and use ROS 2 as the core middleware for humanoid robot control, bridging AI agents written in Python with physical robot components.

Chapters:
1. Introduction to ROS 2 and the Robotic Nervous System
2. ROS 2 Communication: Nodes, Topics, and Services
3. Humanoid Modeling with URDF and Python Control (rclpy)
```

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive specification for the ROS 2 module following the template structure. The specification includes three prioritized user stories covering ROS 2 fundamentals, communication patterns, and robot modeling/control. It defines functional requirements FR-001 through FR-007 that cover educational content, hands-on exercises, and practical implementations. Success criteria SC-001 through SC-005 provide measurable outcomes for student learning. The specification addresses the needs of intermediate AI and software engineering students learning to use ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robotics, with a focus on bridging AI agents in Python with physical robot components.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete specification document for the ROS 2 educational module that covers all three planned chapters and meets the educational goals outlined in the requirements.
